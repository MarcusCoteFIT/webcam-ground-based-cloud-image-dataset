# webcam-ground-based-cloud-image-dataset

The WEBcam Clouds for Aviation Meteorology (WEBCAM) Dataset is a ground-based cloud image dataset for the training and testing of supervised computer vision models. The dataset consists of over 15,500 rigorously labeled images among nine categories, including altocumulus (Ac), cumulonimbus (Cb), Cirrus (Ci), clear sky (Clear), fair-weather cumulus (Cu), fog/obscuration (Obsc), rain/precipitation (Precip), stratus (St), and towering cumulus (TCu).

The dataset is available for public download in association with the manuscript [Ground-Based Cloud Type Classification for Aviation Weather Hazard Detection Using Deep Learning](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3634057). Please refer to the manuscript for additonal details. Please cite the dataset using:
