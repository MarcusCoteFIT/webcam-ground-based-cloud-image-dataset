# webcam-ground-based-cloud-image-dataset

The WEBcam Clouds for Aviation Meteorology (WEBCAM) Dataset is a ground-based cloud image dataset for the training and testing of computer vision models. The dataset consists of over 15,500 rigorously labeled images among nine categories, including altocumulus (Ac), cumulonimbus (Cb), Cirrus (Ci), clear sky (Clear), fair-weather cumulus (Cu), fog/obscuration (Obsc), rain/precipitation (Precip), stratus (St), and towering cumulus (TCu).

The dataset will be released for public download upon publication of the associated manuscript. Reviewers may request restricted access to the dataset and Python code by contacting mcote2021@my.fit.edu.
